## General Information
An introduction to the data used can be found within the READ.md file here: [https://github.com/xqwen/bios626.git](https://github.com/xqwen/bios626.git). The training data set consists of 7,767 observations, and the testing data set consists of 3,162 observations, each consisting of 561 features. All code used can be viewed in either `Midterm_code.Rmd` or `Midterm_code.html`. Note that the .html document shows some expected output and must be downloaded locally and opened in a browser for access.

## Objectives
1. Compute maximum likelihood estimates based on a model approapriate for the data. 
2. Address the multicollinearity issue in the potential predictors.
3. Utilize methods that prevent overfitting the model. 
4. Investigate methoods to improve accuracy during the cross validation procedure.

## Programming language and Necessary Packages
R/Rstudio was used to perform all methods. There are multiple packages required to run `Midterm_code.Rmd` to reproduce results. The following are the require packages:
- **dplyr**:
